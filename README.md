**Introduction**

This repo contains the code for the first project for EE3-24 Embedded Systems - Imperial College London modole.
Coursework: Design an Internet-of-things ubiquitous sensor with micropython.

**Files**

This repo consists of three folders (Rasberry Pi code, Android App code and Website code).

**Asthmaway**

Imagine being paralyzed by fear as you struggle to breathe, unable to speak, unable to ask for help. That's what an asthma attack feels like.

Every 10 seconds someone is having a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK. Every day, the lives of three families are devastated by the death of a loved one to an asthma attack, and tragically two thirds of these deaths are preventable.
1.11 Million Children suffer from Asthma in the UK. Thatâ€™s almost 1/11 children who must know how to efficiently and effectively use their inhaler.

Breathaway allows children to do just that! By providing them and their parents with vital real time information on the intake of their prescribed dose of inhaler medicine.
 
In conjunction with our android app breathaway guides the children into taking their medicine effectively by telling them when to press to induce dose and tell them to continue breathing until the full dose has been taken. This is key for children and seniors who have been just introduced to the inhaler and require a spacer to inhale the full dose.

Our app registers the number of breaths per dose as well as the total number of doses and the number of doses taken correctly. It sends reminders to their mobile phones when it is time to take a dose and can even send all this data to a data base that could be accessed by their gp in order to fully track their progress.
